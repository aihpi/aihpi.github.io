# AI Services Computing Resources

The AI Service Centre provides a heterogeneous AI infrastructure that meets the requirements and needs of research, startups, or small/medium-sized enterprises. In addition to a specialized training and inference cluster, it includes an ARM-based system and small and medium general-purpose servers. This infrastructure enables:

* Exploration of edge applications
* Comparison of costs and performance of different hardware types
* Flexible solutions in the development, optimization, and implementation of complex AI models in production environments
