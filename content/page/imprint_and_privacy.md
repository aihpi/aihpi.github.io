## Privacy Notice

In general, our website can be used anonymously. The provision of personal data is purely voluntary and you will always be informed if and for what purpose we want to save your data. 
Personal data is the data that allows us to identify you and/or to contact you. This includes your name, your postal address or email address.


## Data Privacy Policy

### 1. Introduction

This Data Privacy Policy provides you with information about how we collect, use, and manage your personal data when you visit our website. Protecting your privacy is of utmost importance to us, and we are committed to transparency in all of our data processing practices.

In general, our website can be used anonymously. The provision of personal data is purely voluntary and you will always be informed if and for what purpose we want to save your data. Personal data is the data that allows us to identify you and/or to contact you. This includes your name, your postal address or email address.

##  Voluntary provision of your data
You are not required to provide personal information to us. However, by not providing us with certain information (for example, how to contact you if you would like an answer from us), it is possible that we will be unable to complete your request. In the context of special procedures (for example, when you register for an event or our newsletter), you may again be required to provide us with certain information. Without this data we may not, for example, be able to process your registration or send you our newsletter. You will be expressly informed if this should be the case.

## Recipients of your data
Generally, your personal data remains within our area of responsibility, except in special cases (e.g., co-operative events), in which we will then explicitly inform you to whom your data will be sent. If compelling circumstances arise, it may be necessary to pass on your data to external consultants, for example to lawyers in the case of legal disputes (legal basis Art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 letter f GDPR; purpose and legitimate interest: the exercising, defending or asserting of legal rights). In certain areas, such as web hosting, e-mail hosting and event management, we use specialized service providers. These are strictly bound to our instructions with an order processing contract and are not allowed to process the data for their own purposes. Our data protection officer has extensive rights of control, accorded by Art. 37, 38 GDPR, and therefore access to personal data (legal basis Art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 letter c in conjunction with Art. 37, 38 GDPR). Further recipients of your data are listed in the notes on the respective data processing. In certain cases, we may need to disclose your personal information to third parties so that you can receive the service you want; this means to vicarious agents, for example banks and other payment service providers or to postal service providers. In certain areas, such as web hosting and email hosting, we use specialized service providers. These providers are strictly bound by our instructions through an agreement on commissioned data processing and may not process the data for their own purposes. If in special cases (e.g., co-operative events with partners outside of the EU), your data will be transferred to third countries, we will inform you of this and, if required, also separately about the legal basis and level of data protection.

## Automated decision-making, profiling
Your data will not be used for automated decision-making or profiling.

## Your rights
Under the relevant legal requirements, you have the right to receive information about your data, the right to have such data corrected or deleted, the right to the restriction of processing, the right to object to processing, and the right to data tranferability. In particular, you have the right to object to the processing of your data for advertising purposes at any time without incurring costs other than the transmission costs, according to the rates of your provider (e.g., the costs of an email=usually none). This applies, for example, if you have registered for an event and do not wish  to be informed about similar events.  If the data processing is based on consent, you have the right to revoke your consent at any time without this affecting the legality of the processing being carried out on the basis of consent to revocation or processing on any other legal basis. If you want to exercise these rights, you can simply write to datenschutz(at)hpi.de or click on the unsubscribe link in any email newsletter to unsubscribe. If we call you, you can also communicate this to us directly.

You also have the right to complain to a data protection supervisory authority about our processing of your personal data, for example to the supervisory authority whom we answer to: Die Landesbeauftragte für den Datenschutz und für das Recht auf Akteneinsicht, Stahnsdorfer Damm 77, 14532 Kleinmachnow, Tel: +49 (0)33203 356-0, Fax: +49 (0)33203 356-49, Email: poststelle(at)lda.brandenburg.de.

If you have questions or requests regarding data protection, you can contact us at any time. Your contact is: datenschutz(at)hpi.de.

## Your right to object to data processing
Insofar as the processing of your personal data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 letter e or f GDPR, you have the right to object to processing in accordance with Art. 21 GDPR. If your objection is made for reasons arising from your particular situation, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or for the establishment, exercise of defence against legal claims. If your opposition is directed against direct marketing, including profiling, insofar as it is connected with such direct mail, we will no longer process your personal data for these purposes.

#### a. GitHub Pages

By visiting our website hosted on GitHub Pages, certain information is automatically sent to GitHub's servers by the internet browser used by the data subject. This information is temporarily stored in a so-called server log file. The following information is collected without any action on your part and stored until automated deletion:

- IP address of the requesting computer,
- Date and time of access,
- Name and URL of the retrieved file,
- Website from which access is made (referrer URL),
- Browser used and, if applicable, the operating system of your computer as well as the name of your access provider.

GitHub uses this data to ensure a smooth connection setup of the website, to improve the security and stability of the system, and for administrative purposes. The legal basis for the data processing is Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. Our legitimate interest follows from the purposes listed above for data collection. Under no circumstances do we use the collected data for the purpose of drawing conclusions about you personally.
