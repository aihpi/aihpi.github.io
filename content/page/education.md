# AI Engineer Certification

To acquire an AI Engineer Certification, candidates must first obtain the following AI Expert Certifications, offered by AI Service Center at HPI:

- **Training and Evaluating Machine Learning Models Certification (ML Expert)**
- **MLOps Certification**
- **Responsible AI Certification**

Additionally, they must achieve at least three of the following AI Expert Certifications:

- **Computer Vision Certification**
- **Natural Language Processing Certification**
- **Multimodal ML Certification**
- **Generative AI Certification**

The optional AI Expert certifications have overlapping content. For example, both the Computer Vision and NLP certifications cover topics in image and text generation that intersect with the Generative AI Certification. This structure allows candidates to select a path aligning with their focus and adds value to their careers while maintaining rigor.

## Evaluation

To acquire the certificates, candidates must pass both:

- **Knowledge test** (either live at HPI or online and proctored through Proctorio)
- **Interview based on a portfolio project** (public Github repository) related to the content of the certification

A list of suggested portfolio projects for each certification will be published on the AI Expert Blog.


## Cost

Each evaluation will carry a fee of 200 EUR. 

We intend to subsidize a significant portion of the exam cost for the initial groups of candidates. Candidates that score over 90% in both evaluations individually will receive a full refund, as long as funding is available.

## Validity

Certificates will be valid for five years.
